## Score in a game

### Standard game

A standard game is scored as follows with the server's score being called first:

No point - "Love"  
First point - "15"  
Second point - "30"  
Third point - "40"  
Fourth point - "Game"

except that if each player has won three points, the score is "Deuce".
After "Deuce", the score is "Advantage" for the player who wins the
next point. If that same player also wins the next point, that player
wins the "Game"; if the opposing player wins the next point, the score is
again "Deuce". A player needs to win two consecutive points
immediately after "Deuce" to win the "Game".

### Tie-break game

During a tie-break game, points are scored "Zero", "1", "2", "3", etc. The first
player to win seven points wins the "Game" and "Set", provided there is
a margin of two points over the opponent. If necessary, the tie-break game
shall continue until this margin is achieved.

The player whose turn it is to serve shall serve the first point of the tie-break
game. The following two points shall be served by the opponent (in
doubles, the player of the opposing team due to serve next). After this, each
player shall serve alternately for two consecutive points until the end of
the tie-break game (in doubles, the rotation of service within each team shall
continue in the same order as during that set).

The player whose turn it was to serve first in the tie-break game shall be
the receiver in the first game of the following set.

## Score in a set

There are different methods of scoring in a set. The two main methods are the
"Advantage Set" and the "Tie-break Set". Either method may be used provided that
the one to be used is announced in advance of the event. If the "Tie-break Set"
method is to be used, it must also be announced whether the final set will be played
as a "Tie-break Set" or an "Advantage Set".

### Advantage Set
The first player to win six games wins that "Set", provided there is a
margin of two games over the opponent. If necessary, the set shall continue
until this margin is achieved.

### Tie-break Set
The first player to win six games wins that "Set", provided there is a
margin of two games over the opponent. If the score reaches six games all,
a tie-break game shall be played.

## Score in a match

A match can be played to the best of 3 sets (a player needs to win 2 sets to win
the match) or to the best of 5 sets (a player needs to win 3 sets to win the
match).
