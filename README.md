## SCORE IN A GAME

### Standard game
A standard game is scored as follows with the server’s score being called first:

   No point - “Love”   
   First point - “15”
   Second point - “30”
   Third point - “40”
   Fourth point - “Game”

except that if each player/team has won three points, the score is “Deuce”.
After “Deuce”, the score is “Advantage” for the player/team who wins the
next point. If that same player/team also wins the next point, that player/team
wins the “Game”; if the opposing player/team wins the next point, the score is
again “Deuce”. A player/team needs to win two consecutive points
immediately after “Deuce” to win the “Game”.

### Tie-break game

During a tie-break game, points are scored “Zero”, “1”, “2”, “3”, etc. The first
player/team to win seven points wins the “Game” and “Set”, provided there is
a margin of two points over the opponent(s). If necessary, the tie-break game
shall continue until this margin is achieved.

The player whose turn it is to serve shall serve the first point of the tie-break
game. The following two points shall be served by the opponent(s) (in
doubles, the player of the opposing team due to serve next). After this, each
player/team shall serve alternately for two consecutive points until the end of
the tie-break game (in doubles, the rotation of service within each team shall
continue in the same order as during that set).

The player/team whose turn it was to serve first in the tie-break game shall be
the receiver in the first game of the following set.
Additional approved alternative scoring methods can be found in Appendix V.

## SCORE IN A SET

There are different methods of scoring in a set. The two main methods are the
“Advantage Set” and the “Tie-break Set”. Either method may be used provided that
the one to be used is announced in advance of the event. If the “Tie-break Set”
5
method is to be used, it must also be announced whether the final set will be played
as a “Tie-break Set” or an “Advantage Set”.

a. “Advantage Set”
The first player/team to win six games wins that “Set”, provided there is a
margin of two games over the opponent(s). If necessary, the set shall continue
until this margin is achieved.

b. “Tie-break Set”
The first player/team to win six games wins that “Set”, provided there is a
margin of two games over the opponent(s). If the score reaches six games all,

a tie-break game shall be played.
Additional approved alternative scoring methods can be found in Appendix V.

## SCORE IN A MATCH

A match can be played to the best of 3 sets (a player/team needs to win 2 sets to win
the match) or to the best of 5 sets (a player/team needs to win 3 sets to win the
match).
